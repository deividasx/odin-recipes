    <p>Sweet as lullaby and the biggest plate of yams - it's one of the few true joys of life.
    <br>This recipe makes it simple to nail your cooking to a perfection and the infused butter will take it to the next level.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A Ribeye Steak<ul>
            <li>Taken out of the fridge 10 to 20 minutes before cooking to let it rest</li>
            <li>Aim for more marbling when shopping as there is tons of flavour in the fat</li>
            <li>Pat dry with a J-Cloth before cooking</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>A bulb of Garlic</li>
        <li>Some fresh Thymre or Rosemary</li>
        <li>1/3 block of Butter</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper<ul><li>You should aim to have both fine salt and some coarse salt, like Maldon</li></ul></li>
        <li>Splash of Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the garlic-infused butter<ol>
            <li>Heat the butter in a microwave to a room temperature<br>(just soft enough that you can mix everything but not liquid)</li>
            <li>Peel and finely mince the garlic clove</li>
            <li>Chop or pluck the Rosemary or Thyme</li>
            <li>Ground some black pepper</li>
            <li>Combine everything until well mixed</li>
            <li>Set aside</li>
        </ol></li>
        <li>Heat the pan to a medium-high temperature</li>
        <li>Pat the streak dry if you havent done so using a disposable cloth</li>
        <li>Coat the steak with a tiny amount of oil and then a small amount of fine salt (more will be added at the end)</li>
        <li>Using a pair of tongs, hold the steak firmly and place it in the pan</li>
        <li>Keep turning the steak every 30-45 seconds until you reach you prefered doneness<ul>
            <li>2-3 Minutes for Rare</li>
            <li>4-5 Minutes for Medium to Memdium Rare</li>
            <li>6-8 Minutes for Well-Done<br>
            <em>These are general guidelines for a steak that is 10 to 15cm thick</em></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>On a plate, put a few spoons of the garlic butter and spread it to the size of your steak</li>
        <li>Take the steak out of the pan and place it on the plate, on top of the butter</li>
        <li>Put a few spoons of the garlic butter on top of the steak and let it rest for a few minutes before cutting into it</li>
        <li>Finish with Maldon salt to taste</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Simple as that! Now enjoy it with your favorite sides and condiments before it gets cold!<br>
