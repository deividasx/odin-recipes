The task seemed a bit daunting at first, then it became quite tedious.
To be fair, some of the commands I had completely forgotten, especially ralating to git.
Good task of being organised and concise with practical application.

After 2 month break everything seemed new again.
Had to relearn everything and then move on to CSS after.
Bit difficult at first but now I seem to have a basic understanding of both HTML and CSS and how they work together.
